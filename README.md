# FEAT
FEAT = “Feedback & Evaluation via Automated Tests".

FEAT auto-generates a set of black box test cases for a function given a specification. Used to generate many of the test cases used in COMP 140 + Rice-developed MOOCs. 

Takes a data-driven approach to test case generation

○ Uses a corpus of buggy implementations of the function under test as a “training set”

○ Outputs a test suite that can be used to efficiently evaluate new implementations of the same function
